# INITIAL CODE AND RESULT
# OUTLIER DETECTION
# AUTHOR:  HOAN BAO NGOC NGO
# STUDENT ID: 501009323_642

```{r}

# STEP 1: LOADING DATA, PLOT, CONVERT DATA TO NUMERIC 
# Load the original dataset
```{r}
FullSet =read.csv("G:/sonar/Auto_Theft_2014_to_2019.csv", header = T)
```
#having a glance of the dataset
```{r}
head(FullSet)
```

```{r}
unique(FullSet$occurrenceyear)
```

#Cleaning up data, start removing columns that we don't need to use.
#Reason: either represent same value (such as MCI, offense) or not relevant to this project (event id, for officier use only)
```{r}
AutoTheft  = select(FullSet, -c( Lat, Long ,MCI,Ã¯..X, Y, event_unique_id, offence))
head(AutoTheft)
```

#let see if we need to remove a few more column if they contain the exact same value
```{r}
unique(AutoTheft$ucr_code)
unique(AutoTheft$ucr_ext)
```

#Both column provide the same value, no need to use it here. Then I will also remove it.
```{r}
AutoTheft = select(AutoTheft, -c(ucr_code,ucr_ext ))
```

#Having a statistic glance of the dataset
```{r}
summary (AutoTheft)
```

#since our dataset contains large attributes, I will show unique vales of the dataset as a glance.
```{r}
Permise = unique(AutoTheft$premisetype)
Permise
```

#converting data
#converting OCCURENCE Month
```{r}
AutoTheft$occurrencemonth = match(AutoTheft$occurrencemonth, month.name)
print(head(AutoTheft$occurrencemonth))
```

#CONVERT REPORT MONTH
```{r}
AutoTheft$reportedmonth = match(AutoTheft$reportedmonth, month.name)
print(unique(AutoTheft$reportedmonth))
```
#CONVERT OCCURENCE DATE
```{r}
AutoTheft$occurrencedate = as.Date(AutoTheft$occurrencedate)
head(AutoTheft$occurrencedate)
```

#CONVERT REPORTED DATE
```{r}
AutoTheft$reporteddate = as.Date(AutoTheft$reporteddate)
head(AutoTheft$reporteddate)
```
#CONVERT WEEK DAY
```{r}
AutoTheft$reporteddayofweek = weekdays(AutoTheft$reporteddayofweek)
```
#Removing missing value
```{r}
AutoTheft = na.omit(AutoTheft)
```
#PLOT
```{r}
par(mfrow = c(3,1))
```
# As seen in plot, number of report cases surged from 2018 to 2019
```{r}
ggplot2(AutoTheft, aes(reportedyear))+geom_bar()
hist(AutoTheft$occurrenceyear, main = "Occurance year of incidient", xlab = "Year", xlim = c(2013,2019),ylim = c(0,6000),label = T, col = 'pink') 
```
#I mean to put ggplot above hist, so when the code run, we can see 2 graphs into each others
#Box plot to show the relation of Occurrence year and month reported
```{r}
boxplot(AutoTheft$reportedmonth ~ AutoTheft$occurrenceyear, notch = T , las = 1) 
```

#Box plot to show the relation of Hood ID and when the incident was report (month)
```{r}

boxplot(AutoTheft$reportedmonth  ~ AutoTheft$Hood_ID, xlab = 'Hood Id', ylab = 'Reported Month', las  = 1)
```
#Showing which Hood ID has the highest cases of incidents. 
```{r}
hist(AutoTheft$Hood_ID,label = T)
```

#the plot here show us even more information, the year of incident, the hours and the neighbour hood (as hood_id)
```{r}
ggplot(data = AutoTheft) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = occurrenceyear, y = occurrencehour, color = Hood_ID))
```

#table of sum
#sum of count of premise type
```{r}
table(AutoTheft$premisetype)
```

#sum of month of incidents
```{r}

Count_of_month = table(AutoTheft$occurrencemonth)
Count_of_month
plot(Count_of_month, main = "Count of month")


Count_of_day = table(AutoTheft$occurrenceday)
plot(Count_of_day)
```
#What i found here is that October and November have a highest rate of incident.
#Does it relate to the weather, when it is not full of snow like December and Jan or Feb, which make the crime easy to commit?
#October and Fall are also in fall, which offer the most beautiful view, and outdoor activities such as hiking, biking or taking a walk.
#Should citizen aware of this information, so that they can be careful, and data will be collected to see if the rate actually drops?  

#showing the relation of 2 categorical data and numeric.
```{r}
ggplot(data = AutoTheft) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x= premisetype, y = occurrenceyear, color= Hood_ID), size = 4)
```
#showing when incidient happens, weekday or weekend, at home or outside, in which neighbourhood. 
```{r}
ggplot(data = AutoTheft) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x= premisetype, y = occurrencedayofweek, color= Hood_ID))
```

#STEP 2: SPLIT DATA AND CLUSTERING DATA

#1. CLUSTERING DATA. 
#IN THIS STEP, DATA ARE CONVERT TO NUMERIC IN ORDER TO PERFORM CLUSTER BY K-MEANS 
```{r}
Set1= select(AutoTheft,-c(2,3,4,9,15,17,19))
head(Set1)
```
#DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE DATA, IM NOT SURE HERE IF ITS A GOOD IDEA TO SCALE OR NORMALIZE DATA
```{r}
head(scale(Set1))
```

#I WAS THINKING TO CHOOSE GOWER METHOD, BUT FOUND MYSELF NOT CONFIDENT YET. 
#THIS IS JUST A NOTE FOR MYSELF.
```{r}
gower_dist = daisy(Set1, metric = 'gower')
gower_mat  = as.matrix(gower_dist)
```

#USING K-CLUSTER
```{r}
Clus = kmeans(Set1, centers = 5)
str(Clus)

```

#HAVING A PROBLEM HERE TO VISUALIZE THE CLUSTER (STILL WORKING ON IT)
```{r}
clusplot(Clus)
```

#SPLITTING DATA
```{r}
sampleset = sample(1:nrow(AutoTheft), 0.7 * nrow(AutoTheft))
train.set = AutoTheft[sampleset,]
test.set = AutoTheft[-sampleset,]
print(train.set)
print(test.set)
```


#I will remove OBJECT iD in both set 
```{r}
train.set = train.set[-23]
test.set = test.set[-23]
```


#NOTE: STILL A FEW STEP TO BE CLEAR ON, AND I AM KINDA NOT SURE WHERE TO GO, WILL CONTACT FOR HELP FOR FURTHER QUESTION.
